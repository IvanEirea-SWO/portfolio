Hello! And welcome to this repository, where you can find the code to do a portfolio of your own. To be correct, this is the code of *my* portfolio but you can use it whatever you want.

I'm planning on making a big revamp of this project and maybe to start totally from scratch again so. Another feature that I will definitely add in the future is the option to switch between different languages, those including: Spanish, English, Japanese, Chinese and Hindi for sure, but maybe some more.

See you! 🧙‍♂️
